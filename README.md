Hello Viewer,

Thank you for accessing my profile.

This application will show a bunch of certificates earned by myself in different online platforms ( udemy, coursera, LinkedIn...)

Certificates are uploaded to an image hosting site. each image information is saved in MongoDb Atlas database along with the image url from the image hosting site so it can be retrieved and displayed.

During the application's implementation, the languages used are "javascript", "html", "css". Frameworks used are "nodejs" and "ejs". Other technologies used for this matter are: ejs, sass.

No fancy front-end layout is demonstrated since the main goal of this application is to practice my skills on MongoDb CRUD operations, developing a decent back-end environment, using routing for different request types and more.

This application will be scaled through time when needed.
